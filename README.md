--------------------

Thank you all for your interest in this research project. I am currently optimizing the model's performance and computation efficiency. I plan to release a user-friendly version, either a GUI or a VST, in the first half of this year, and will update the open-source license.

If you are familiar with PyTorch, you can follow [Code Examples](#examples) to use Diff-Pitcher.

## Demo

ðŸŽµ Listen to [examples](https://jhu-lcap.github.io/Diff-Pitcher/)

## Todo
- [x] Update codes and demo
- [x] Support ðŸ¤— [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)
- [x] Upload checkpoints
- [x] Pipeline tutorial
- [ ] Merge to [Your-Stable-Audio](https://github.com/haidog-yaqub/Your-Stable-Audio)
- [ ] Audio Plugin Support
## Instructions
- Run: Clone Repo and install dependencies
- Run: Download Models
- Feel free to try:

  - template-based automatic pitch correction: [template_based_apc.py](template_based_apc.py)
    ```bibtex    
    Use a third reference voice to tune the input voice.
    --i: input voice path
    --r: reference voice path
    --o: output voice path
    !python template_based_apc.py --i "/content/DiffPitcher/voice.wav" --r "/content/DiffPitcher/guide.wav" --o output_template.wav


  - score-based automatic pitch correction: [score_based_apc.py](score_based_apc.py)
    ```bibtex
    Use a MIDI file as a reference to tune voices.
    --i: input voice path
    --r: reference MIDI path
    --o: output voice path
    !python score_based_apc.py --i "/content/DiffPitcher/voice.wav" --r "/content/DiffPitcher/guide.mid" --o output_score.wav
